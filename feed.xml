VSTS is the online platform from Microsoft to save your code. A VSTS project is free when there are 5 users or less and can function as a free private source control for small teams and projects. It also has Scrum/Kanban board functionality to manage a backlog and issues. But the best feature might be that you can use the  build and deployment features to fully adopt a DevOps way of working.  In this blogpost I will be showing how to create and run a build using VSTS. In a next blog post I will cover how to set up a deployment to Azure using the output of the build.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if you are not using a build for creating deployments, they still ensure that the source repository does not only build on your machine. It can also run your unit tests for you if you forget to run them yourself. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the past you always needed to set up a server or workstation with a build agent installed to set up builds, but I recently learned that there are Hosted Agents that actually spin up a build agent for you in the cloud and publish the build output (deployment assets) to an output folder. You can then use the deployment pipelines to deploy these assets to Azure or a server. To see what builds are supported by the Hosted Agent see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/agents/hosted&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft Docs page&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;p&gt;
To set up a VSTS project visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/&lt;/a&gt;. You can create builds for other source control providers like GitHub so you can create a build but will not have to migrate your source control and lose any check-in history.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up a build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this example I will be setting up a build for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SamanthaNeilen/ECommerceSampleApplication&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;ECommerceSampleApplication repository&lt;/a&gt; that is hosted on GitHub. It contains a .Net Framework 4.6.1 MVC application, a supporting database project and some unit tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First go to your team project. Go to the builds section under Build and Release. Then click the New button to start a new build definition.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/CreateNewBuildDefinition.png&quot; alt=&quot;Create New Build Definition&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
I want to create a build for my GitHub repository so I choose GitHub as my provided and created a connection to GitHub using my username and password. (Note that the process of creating the connection to GitHub uses several pop-ups and may not work properly in all browsers.)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/ConnectToSource.png&quot; alt=&quot;Connect To Source Control Provider&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After clicking continue you get the option of selecting a specific build template for your type of project. If you want more details on the templates or the build steps included, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/SelectBuildTemplate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Select A Build Template&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I chose the ASP.Net project template. It gets my sources, restores my NuGet packages, builds the solution, runs the unittests, sets up publishing of the pdb files for remote debugging and publishes the build artifacts (project output) to the VSTS deployment/download location. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/BuildSolutionStepDefaults.png&quot; alt=&quot;Build Solution Step Defaults&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can actually just use most of the defaults for my project. I don’t need the publish symbol paths task so I deleted it. In the Build Solution Task, note the input field for Platform and Configuration. These variables will be populated with values from the Variables tab. In this task also notice the MSBuild arguments. This configuration will output the deployment package for my web package to the artifact staging directory. Seeing as my MVC project is not only the project I wanted to build and deploy, I removed everything in the MSBuild Arguments except the /p DeployOnBuild=true argument. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/BuildSolutionStepAfterChanges.png&quot; alt=&quot;Build Solution Step After Changes&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Next I added 2 custom steps to copy the deployment files from the website and database projects. The Copy tasks are shown in the images below.  (All advanced and control options settings were not changed from the defaults)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/CopyWebFilesTask.png&quot; alt=&quot;Copy Web Files Task&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/CopyDatabaseFilesTask.png&quot; alt=&quot;Copy Database Files Task&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have tests in your solution that run as integration tests and cannot and connect to resources like the database or a webservice from the test run process, you could choose exclude them in the Test Assemblies task via the Test filter criteria box. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/TestFilterAttribute.png&quot; alt=&quot;Test Filter Attribute Field&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
Most input fields in the tasks have an information icon to figure out how the fields are used. Also again look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/&lt;/a&gt; for more guidance on specific needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also check out the settings under the other tabs of the build. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/BuildTemplateTabsMenu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Build Template Tabs Menu&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Triggers allow you to configure whether or not to use gated checkins or trigger the build on a checkin or to schedule the build as a nightly or other scheduled build. &lt;br /&gt;
- The Options tab allows you to configure the name and versioning of the build output. &lt;br /&gt;
- Retention specifies how long the assets will be maintained. &lt;br /&gt;
- History will contain references to builds for this template if you have already triggered the build template before.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that you have a build template you can save or save and queue. The save and queue option will immediately start the dialog to start a build using the template.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/SaveAndQueueDialog.png&quot; alt=&quot;Save And Queue Dialog&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here you can see the Agent Queue and you can select the hosted queues provided by VSTS or any private build agents that you have configured. Also note the variables, you can change their values here. If you have set up an additional variable in the Variables tab of the build template and you want to set the value at every build, then be sure to check the &quot;Settable on queue time&quot; option
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the build has been queued you can see the status under the build tab. Click on the version number link to see the progress and details for a build.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/BuildsOverview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Builds Overview&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
If you are running private agents or multiple builds you might sometimes see the Status as waiting for available agent. If this happens you can check out the agents workload under the Gear icon under the Agent Queue option. You need certain account permissions on the project to access this information and it may not be visible if you do not have permission.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/AgentQueueOverview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Agent Queue Overview&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After a build completes you get an email with the results and you can view the results in the build details after it finishes. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/BuildSummary.png&quot; alt=&quot;Build Summary&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The resulting output of the build (or rather the artifacts) can be found under the artifacts tab.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180210/ArtifactOverview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Artifact Overview&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
You could download the artifacts and manually release or publish them or discover the output files of the build in this tab.
&lt;/p&gt;

In this blogpost I will be talking on how to create tests using Coded UI and Selenium. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coded UI is the UI testing framework from Microsoft for testing any type of UI that runs on the windows platform. This means you can test websites as well as WPF or other windows applications. Coded UI is shipped as a module on Visual Studio. Currently Coded UI is only shipped with Visual Studio Enterprise editions. For the currently automatable configurations see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/visualstudio/test/supported-configurations-and-platforms-for-coded-ui-tests-and-action-recordings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Supported configurations and platforms forCoded UI tests and action recordings&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coded UI supports IE website testing out of the box and you can install an extension to run tests in other browsers including Edge using Selenium drivers (another UI test framework). Note that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AtinBansal.SeleniumcomponentsforCodedUICrossBrowserTesting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Selenium Cross Browser tools&lt;/a&gt; have not been updated in a while and is no longer fully compatible with the latest version of the Selenium implementation. Updating the Selenium drivers of the cross-browser tools to the latest version will break functionality like finding a dropdown on a page. Therefor I recommend using Selenium to test your website if you want to test in multiple and the latest browsers that are not Internet Explorer. You can also use Selenium to automate actions within the browser windows and use Coded UI to manipulate the browser application itself.  (For example controlling the browser dialog windows.) Also Selenium is free and open source. If you do not have a Visual Studio Enterprise edition, definitely look into Selenium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
UI testing is a great method of automating regression tests for your applications. This way you can avoid human errors in repetitive tasks and when run during development of changes, you may possibly spot bugs before you hand of a new change to your QA team.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please note that all the sample tests later in this blog post are just simple examples to help you get started. If you wish to build an extensive test library please look into building your own UI test framework using the page-object approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up a Code UI project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start with Coded UI make sure you have the Coded UI project type installed. It can be found under test projects.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/VisualStudioTestProjects.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio Test Project Templates&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you do not see anything else than the Unit Test Project type, it means that you have not yet installed it. Open Visual Studio Installer, modify your Visual Studio Enterprise Edition and under Individual Components select the Coded UI test option under the Debugging and Testing section.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/VisualStudioInstaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio Installation Coded UI CheckBox&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
After creating your new Coded UI project, the project will add a test class and a UI Map file. Visual Studio will also startup the UIMap - Coded UI Test Builder. This tool is used to record or inspect elements on your screen. If you close it you can restart it by right clicking a .uitest file or Map file as they are called and select the Edit with Coded UI Test Builder option.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/CleanCodedUIProject.png&quot; alt=&quot;Default Coded UI Project Files And Test Builder Window&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can now either start coding or recording tests. If you press the record button, do some clicks in any application in your windows machine and then click the generate code button. Visual Studio will generate the code for the actions you took in the CodedUITest.cs file. All code for UI controls is placed inside the UIMap.uittest file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Recording UI tests can be helpful to start up fast but will be less maintainable in the long run, so I wish to focus on writing tests by hand for your applications. The Coded UI Test Builder is a great tool for inspecting controls on the screen and showing you the properties that Coded UI can access. These properties can also be used to search controls as I will explain later on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To use the Coded UI Test Builder element inspector, click and drag the circle button to any UI element that you want to inspect. You will see a blue highlight on the control that is focused. When releasing your mouse, a properties window will popup showing you the details of the control that you have selected. When inspecting an UI element in a browser it may take a second or so for the highlight to get into the page. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A windows application example of inspecting a button is shown below:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/WindowsButtonProperties.png&quot; alt=&quot;Windows Button Properties&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And here is an example of inspecting a button in a web page:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/WebButtonProperties.png&quot; alt=&quot;Web Button Properties&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up a simple WPF test with Coded UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A working sample of the code below including the sample application that it is run on can be found in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SamanthaNeilen/CodedUITestApplication&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CodedUITestApplication repository&lt;/a&gt;.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The class containing the test must be decorated with the [CodedUITest] attribute. The test method itself is decorated with a [TestMethod] attribute.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.WinControls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.WpfControls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;CodedUITestTestApplication.Tests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CodedUITest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;WindowsAppTests&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TestMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Test_WPF_Addition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ApplicationUnderTest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Launch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&quot;..\..\..\CodedUITestApplication.WPF\bin\Debug\CodedUITestApplication.WPF.exe&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amount1Edit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WpfEdit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resultLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SearchProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WpfEdit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutomationId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;lblResult&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AreEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;15&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resultLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DisplayText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As you can see, you find WPF controls by adding search properties. As long as you are adding search properties, your object in memory will not actually search for the control until you either call TryFind, use the control as parent for another new control, change a property or try to invoke an action on the control in the application. If a control is not found when calling TryFind, false is returned. In all other cases a ControlNotFound exception is thrown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The framework uses certain timeouts when finding controls. These timeouts can be changed by accessing the static PlayBack class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up a simple Windows application test with Coded UI&lt;/h3&gt;

In this example I just boot up and automate the windows calculator.

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Notice that the searching and asserting is the same as with the WPF application. Only the base class for defining the type of control is different. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up a simple web test with Coded UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A webtest is quite similar. Here again the base class for the control is different. Also, we start a BrowserWindow instead of using ApllicationUnderTest. BrowserWindow is actually inherited from ApplicationUnderTest. You can use BrowserWindow.CurrentBrowser (before calling Launch) to determine the browser to use. The default is &quot;IE&quot; and you can use &quot;Chrome&quot; or &quot;Firefox&quot; to start other browsers. Note that Firefox will not start if your browser version is not supported by the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AtinBansal.SeleniumcomponentsforCodedUICrossBrowserTesting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Selenium Cross Browser tools (version &amp;gt; 47.0.1, 32 bit)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Running a single test on multiple browsers using a data source file&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[Edit Feb 16 2018]&lt;/b&gt; Note that the solution described below works for projects using the Coded UI framework. When using the default Microsoft Test V2 framework, the use of the TestSettings files is deprecated and your tests will stay undiscoverable in the Test Explorer window. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SamanthaNeilen/WebDriverTestApplication&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;WebDriverTestApplication repository&lt;/a&gt; for running tests with the MSTest V2 framework. &lt;b&gt;[End edit Feb 16 2018]&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The default unit test framework from Microsoft can consume input files to run your tests for multiple data rows. In the following example I have added a CSV with the browsers names I want to test as data source. When this test is run the test will execute for each browser in sequence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;CodedUITestApplication.Shared.Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.HtmlControls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;HtmlControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SearchProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HtmlControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;addCustomerHeader&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IsFalse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nameValidationmessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TryFind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expectedEmailvalidationMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FieldRequired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EmailAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;emailAddessValidationMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SearchProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HtmlControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;field-validation-error&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;emailAddessValidationMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SearchProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HtmlControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InnerText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expectedEmailvalidationMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
		     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyExpressionOperator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IsTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;emailAddessValidationMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TryFind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IsTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;emailAddessValidationMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InnerText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expectedEmailvalidationMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To ensure that the Browsers datasource is present in your project, first add the file you want to use as a data source to the project. Set the properties of the file to Content and Copy always.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/FileBuildAction.png&quot; alt=&quot;File Properties Build Action&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next define the data source connection string in the App.config of the test project. You will also need to add a configuration section to ensure that the configuration elements will be processed. 

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;configSections&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;microsoft.visualstudio.testtools&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.TestConfigurationSection, 
	    Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework, Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/configSections&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;connectionStrings&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Browsers&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;connectionString=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Browsers.csv&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providerName=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.DataSource.CSV&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/connectionStrings&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;microsoft.visualstudio.testtools&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dataSources&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Browsers&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;connectionString=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Browsers&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;dataTableName=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Browsers#csv&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;dataAccessMethod=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Sequential&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dataSources&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next add a TestSettings file to the solution.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/VisualStudioTestSettings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio Test Settings File Type&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Open the test settings file and navigate to deployment. Check the Enable Deployment option and add the csv file that needs to be deployed when running the test. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/DeploymentSettingBrowsers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Deployment settings Browser tag&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes Visual Studio will not automatically pick up the TestSettings file. If you get errors about not finding the data source first check if the TestSettings file is selected for use.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/VisualStudioTestSettingsMenu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visua Studio Test Settings Menu Option&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up a simple web test with Selenium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[Edit Feb 16 2018]&lt;/b&gt; Note that the solution described below works for projects using the Coded UI framework. When using the default Microsoft Test V2 framework, the use of the TestSettings files is deprecated and your tests will stay undiscoverable in the Test Explorer window. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SamanthaNeilen/WebDriverTestApplication&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;WebDriverTestApplication repository&lt;/a&gt; for running tests with the MSTest V2 framework. &lt;b&gt;[End edit Feb 16 2018]&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this last section I wanted to show a web test using Selenium. To be able to use Selenium in your test project first add the Selenium.Support NuGet package. This package will also automatically add the Selenium.Webdriver package.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/SeleniumNuGetPackages.png&quot; alt=&quot;Selenium NuGet Packages&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next you need to download the driver executables that will actually start and control the browser. The latest driver executables can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Selenium download page&lt;/a&gt;.
Add them to your project and make sure that they get deployed to either the bin folder of the project or add them to the deployment configuration in the TestSettings file as explained in the &quot;Running a single test on multiple browsers using a data source file&quot; section of this post, so that they are in the same directory as the test project output dll.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/SeleniumDrivers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Selenium Driver Files&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20180114/DeploymentSettingsSelenium.png&quot; alt=&quot;Deployment Settings Selenium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After setting up, you can use the test method below to check the same functionality as the Coded UI web test in the last section. Note the different syntax but the same general idea of searching and manipulating controls.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;CodedUITestApplication.Shared.Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.HtmlControls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;OpenQA.Selenium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;OpenQA.Selenium.IE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;System.Configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;System.Linq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;CodedUITestTestApplication.Tests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CodedUITest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;WebTests&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TestMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DataSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Browsers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="TestAutomation" /><summary type="html">In this blogpost I will be talking on how to create tests using Coded UI and Selenium. Coded UI is the UI testing framework from Microsoft for testing any type of UI that runs on the windows platform. This means you can test websites as well as WPF or other windows applications. Coded UI is shipped as a module on Visual Studio. Currently Coded UI is only shipped with Visual Studio Enterprise editions. For the currently automatable configurations see Supported configurations and platforms forCoded UI tests and action recordings. Coded UI supports IE website testing out of the box and you can install an extension to run tests in other browsers including Edge using Selenium drivers (another UI test framework). Note that the Selenium Cross Browser tools have not been updated in a while and is no longer fully compatible with the latest version of the Selenium implementation. Updating the Selenium drivers of the cross-browser tools to the latest version will break functionality like finding a dropdown on a page. Therefor I recommend using Selenium to test your website if you want to test in multiple and the latest browsers that are not Internet Explorer. You can also use Selenium to automate actions within the browser windows and use Coded UI to manipulate the browser application itself. (For example controlling the browser dialog windows.) Also Selenium is free and open source. If you do not have a Visual Studio Enterprise edition, definitely look into Selenium. UI testing is a great method of automating regression tests for your applications. This way you can avoid human errors in repetitive tasks and when run during development of changes, you may possibly spot bugs before you hand of a new change to your QA team. Please note that all the sample tests later in this blog post are just simple examples to help you get started. If you wish to build an extensive test library please look into building your own UI test framework using the page-object approach. Setting up a Code UI project To start with Coded UI make sure you have the Coded UI project type installed. It can be found under test projects. If you do not see anything else than the Unit Test Project type, it means that you have not yet installed it. Open Visual Studio Installer, modify your Visual Studio Enterprise Edition and under Individual Components select the Coded UI test option under the Debugging and Testing section. After creating your new Coded UI project, the project will add a test class and a UI Map file. Visual Studio will also startup the UIMap - Coded UI Test Builder. This tool is used to record or inspect elements on your screen. If you close it you can restart it by right clicking a .uitest file or Map file as they are called and select the Edit with Coded UI Test Builder option. You can now either start coding or recording tests. If you press the record button, do some clicks in any application in your windows machine and then click the generate code button. Visual Studio will generate the code for the actions you took in the CodedUITest.cs file. All code for UI controls is placed inside the UIMap.uittest file. Recording UI tests can be helpful to start up fast but will be less maintainable in the long run, so I wish to focus on writing tests by hand for your applications. The Coded UI Test Builder is a great tool for inspecting controls on the screen and showing you the properties that Coded UI can access. These properties can also be used to search controls as I will explain later on. To use the Coded UI Test Builder element inspector, click and drag the circle button to any UI element that you want to inspect. You will see a blue highlight on the control that is focused. When releasing your mouse, a properties window will popup showing you the details of the control that you have selected. When inspecting an UI element in a browser it may take a second or so for the highlight to get into the page. A windows application example of inspecting a button is shown below: And here is an example of inspecting a button in a web page: Setting up a simple WPF test with Coded UI A working sample of the code below including the sample application that it is run on can be found in my CodedUITestApplication repository. The class containing the test must be decorated with the [CodedUITest] attribute. The test method itself is decorated with a [TestMethod] attribute. using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.WinControls; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.WpfControls; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting; namespace CodedUITestTestApplication.Tests { [CodedUITest] public class WindowsAppTests { [TestMethod] public void Test_WPF_Addition() { var app = ApplicationUnderTest.Launch(@&quot;..\..\..\CodedUITestApplication.WPF\bin\Debug\CodedUITestApplication.WPF.exe&quot;); var amount1Edit = new WpfEdit(app); amount1Edit.SearchProperties.Add(WpfEdit.PropertyNames.AutomationId, &quot;txtFirstAmount&quot;); amount1Edit.Text = &quot;5&quot;; var amount2Edit = new WpfEdit(app); amount2Edit.SearchProperties.Add(WpfEdit.PropertyNames.AutomationId, &quot;txtSecondAmount&quot;); amount2Edit.Text = &quot;10&quot;; var buttonPlus = new WpfButton(app); buttonPlus.SearchProperties.Add(WpfEdit.PropertyNames.AutomationId, &quot;btnAdd&quot;); Mouse.Click(buttonPlus); var resultLabel = new WpfText(app); resultLabel.SearchProperties.Add(WpfEdit.PropertyNames.AutomationId, &quot;lblResult&quot;); Assert.AreEqual(&quot;15&quot;, resultLabel.DisplayText); } } } As you can see, you find WPF controls by adding search properties. As long as you are adding search properties, your object in memory will not actually search for the control until you either call TryFind, use the control as parent for another new control, change a property or try to invoke an action on the control in the application. If a control is not found when calling TryFind, false is returned. In all other cases a ControlNotFound exception is thrown. The framework uses certain timeouts when finding controls. These timeouts can be changed by accessing the static PlayBack class. Setting up a simple Windows application test with Coded UI In this example I just boot up and automate the windows calculator. using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.WinControls; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.WpfControls; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting; namespace CodedUITestTestApplication.Tests { [CodedUITest] public class WindowsAppTests { [TestMethod] public void Test_Windows_Calculator() { var app = ApplicationUnderTest.Launch(@&quot;C:\Windows\system32\calc.exe&quot;); var button5 = new WinButton(app); button5.SearchProperties.Add(WinControl.PropertyNames.Name, &quot;5&quot;); Mouse.Click(button5); var buttonPlus = new WinButton(app); buttonPlus.SearchProperties.Add(WinControl.PropertyNames.Name, &quot;Add&quot;); Mouse.Click(buttonPlus); Mouse.Click(button5); var buttonEquals = new WinButton(app); buttonEquals.SearchProperties.Add(WinControl.PropertyNames.Name, &quot;Equals&quot;); Mouse.Click(buttonEquals); var resultText = new WinText(app); resultText.SearchProperties.Add(WinControl.PropertyNames.Name, &quot;Result&quot;); Assert.AreEqual(&quot;10&quot;, resultText.DisplayText); } } } Notice that the searching and asserting is the same as with the WPF application. Only the base class for defining the type of control is different. Setting up a simple web test with Coded UI A webtest is quite similar. Here again the base class for the control is different. Also, we start a BrowserWindow instead of using ApllicationUnderTest. BrowserWindow is actually inherited from ApplicationUnderTest. You can use BrowserWindow.CurrentBrowser (before calling Launch) to determine the browser to use. The default is &quot;IE&quot; and you can use &quot;Chrome&quot; or &quot;Firefox&quot; to start other browsers. Note that Firefox will not start if your browser version is not supported by the Selenium Cross Browser tools (version &amp;gt; 47.0.1, 32 bit). using CodedUITestApplication.Shared.Resources; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.HtmlControls; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting; using System; using System.Configuration; using System.Linq; [CodedUITest] public class WebTests { protected string StartUrl = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&quot;ApplicationStartUrl&quot;]; [TestMethod] public void WebTest_TestForm() { BrowserWindow browser = BrowserWindow.Launch(new Uri(StartUrl)); var nameTextBox = new HtmlEdit(browser); nameTextBox.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.Id, &quot;Name&quot;); nameTextBox.Text = &quot;Some Name&quot;; var submitButton = new HtmlButton(browser); submitButton.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlButton.PropertyNames.Type, &quot;submit&quot;); Mouse.Click(submitButton); var header = new HtmlControl(browser); header.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.Id, &quot;addCustomerHeader&quot;); Assert.IsTrue(header.TryFind()); var nameValidationmessage = new HtmlSpan(browser); nameValidationmessage.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.Id, &quot;Name-error&quot;); Assert.IsFalse(nameValidationmessage.TryFind()); var expectedEmailvalidationMessage = string.Format(Messages.FieldRequired, Labels.EmailAddress); var emailAddessValidationMessage = new HtmlSpan(browser); emailAddessValidationMessage.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.Class, &quot;field-validation-error&quot;); emailAddessValidationMessage.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.InnerText, expectedEmailvalidationMessage, PropertyExpressionOperator.Contains); Assert.IsTrue(emailAddessValidationMessage.TryFind()); Assert.IsTrue(emailAddessValidationMessage.InnerText.Equals(expectedEmailvalidationMessage)); } } Running a single test on multiple browsers using a data source file [Edit Feb 16 2018] Note that the solution described below works for projects using the Coded UI framework. When using the default Microsoft Test V2 framework, the use of the TestSettings files is deprecated and your tests will stay undiscoverable in the Test Explorer window. See the WebDriverTestApplication repository for running tests with the MSTest V2 framework. [End edit Feb 16 2018] The default unit test framework from Microsoft can consume input files to run your tests for multiple data rows. In the following example I have added a CSV with the browsers names I want to test as data source. When this test is run the test will execute for each browser in sequence. using CodedUITestApplication.Shared.Resources; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.HtmlControls; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting; using System; using System.Configuration; using System.Linq; [CodedUITest] public class WebTests { private TestContext _testContextInstance; public TestContext TestContext { get { return _testContextInstance; } set { _testContextInstance = value; } } protected string StartUrl = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&quot;ApplicationStartUrl&quot;]; [TestMethod, DataSource(&quot;Browsers&quot;)] public void WebTest_TestForm() { var browserIdentifier = &quot;IE&quot;; if (TestContext.DataRow != null) { browserIdentifier = TestContext.DataRow[0].ToString(); } BrowserWindow.CurrentBrowser = browserIdentifier; BrowserWindow browser = BrowserWindow.Launch(new Uri(StartUrl)); var nameTextBox = new HtmlEdit(browser); nameTextBox.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.Id, &quot;Name&quot;); nameTextBox.Text = &quot;Some Name&quot;; var submitButton = new HtmlButton(browser); submitButton.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlButton.PropertyNames.Type, &quot;submit&quot;); Mouse.Click(submitButton); var header = new HtmlControl(browser); header.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.Id, &quot;addCustomerHeader&quot;); Assert.IsTrue(header.TryFind()); var nameValidationmessage = new HtmlSpan(browser); nameValidationmessage.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.Id, &quot;Name-error&quot;); Assert.IsFalse(nameValidationmessage.TryFind()); var expectedEmailvalidationMessage = string.Format(Messages.FieldRequired, Labels.EmailAddress); var emailAddessValidationMessage = new HtmlSpan(browser); emailAddessValidationMessage.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.Class, &quot;field-validation-error&quot;); emailAddessValidationMessage.SearchProperties.Add(HtmlControl.PropertyNames.InnerText, expectedEmailvalidationMessage, PropertyExpressionOperator.Contains); Assert.IsTrue(emailAddessValidationMessage.TryFind()); Assert.IsTrue(emailAddessValidationMessage.InnerText.Equals(expectedEmailvalidationMessage)); } } To ensure that the Browsers datasource is present in your project, first add the file you want to use as a data source to the project. Set the properties of the file to Content and Copy always. Next define the data source connection string in the App.config of the test project. You will also need to add a configuration section to ensure that the configuration elements will be processed. &amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt; &amp;lt;configSections&amp;gt; &amp;lt;section name=&quot;microsoft.visualstudio.testtools&quot; type=&quot;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.TestConfigurationSection, Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework, Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/configSections&amp;gt; &amp;lt;connectionStrings&amp;gt; &amp;lt;add name=&quot;Browsers&quot; connectionString=&quot;Browsers.csv&quot; providerName=&quot;Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.DataSource.CSV&quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/connectionStrings&amp;gt; &amp;lt;microsoft.visualstudio.testtools&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dataSources&amp;gt; &amp;lt;add name=&quot;Browsers&quot; connectionString=&quot;Browsers&quot; dataTableName=&quot;Browsers#csv&quot; dataAccessMethod=&quot;Sequential&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dataSources&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt; Next add a TestSettings file to the solution. Open the test settings file and navigate to deployment. Check the Enable Deployment option and add the csv file that needs to be deployed when running the test. Sometimes Visual Studio will not automatically pick up the TestSettings file. If you get errors about not finding the data source first check if the TestSettings file is selected for use.

See the WebDriverTestApplication repository for running tests with the MSTest V2 framework. [End edit Feb 16 2018] In this last section I wanted to show a web test using Selenium. To be able to use Selenium in your test project first add the Selenium.Support NuGet package. This package will also automatically add the Selenium.Webdriver package. Next you need to download the driver executables that will actually start and control the browser. The latest driver executables can be found on the Selenium download page. Add them to your project and make sure that they get deployed to either the bin folder of the project or add them to the deployment configuration in the TestSettings file as explained in the &quot;Running a single test on multiple browsers using a data source file&quot; section of this post, so that they are in the same directory as the test project output dll. After setting up, you can use the test method below to check the same functionality as the Coded UI web test in the last section. Note the different syntax but the same general idea of searching and manipulating controls. using CodedUITestApplication.Shared.Resources; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.HtmlControls; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting; using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome; using OpenQA.Selenium.IE; using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox; using System; using System.Configuration; using System.Linq; namespace CodedUITestTestApplication.Tests { [CodedUITest] public class WebTests { [TestMethod, DataSource(&quot;Browsers&quot;)] public void WebTest_Selenium_TestForm() { var browserIdentifier = &quot;Chrome&quot;; if (TestContext.DataRow != null) { browserIdentifier = TestContext.DataRow[0].ToString(); } using (var driver = StartWebdriver(browserIdentifier)) { driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(new Uri(StartUrl)); var nameTextBox = driver.FindElement(By.Id(&quot;Name&quot;)); nameTextBox.SendKeys(&quot;Some Name&quot;); var submitButton = driver.FindElement(By.TagName(&quot;button&quot;)); submitButton.Click(); var header = driver.FindElement(By.Id(&quot;addCustomerHeader&quot;)); Assert.IsTrue(header.Displayed); Assert.AreEqual(0, driver.FindElements(By.Id(&quot;Name-error&quot;)).Count); var expectedEmailvalidationMessage = string.Format(Messages.FieldRequired, Labels.EmailAddress); var validationMessages = driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector(&quot;.field-validation-error&quot;)); Assert.IsTrue(validationMessages.Any(element =&amp;gt; element.Displayed &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ChildSpanContainsExpectedText(element, expectedEmailvalidationMessage))); driver.Close(); } } private static bool ChildSpanContainsExpectedText(IWebElement element, string expectedEmailvalidationMessage) { return element.FindElement(By.TagName(&quot;span&quot;)).Text.Equals(expectedEmailvalidationMessage); } private IWebDriver StartWebdriver(string browserIdentifier) { switch (browserIdentifier) { case &quot;IE&quot;: return new InternetExplorerDriver(); case &quot;Firefox&quot;: return new FirefoxDriver(); case &quot;Chrome&quot;: return new ChromeDriver(); default: throw new NotSupportedException(); } } } } Resources Pluralsight- Coded UI Pluralsight- Selenium Microsoft docs - Use UI Automation To Test Your Code Selenium HQ</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tips for making your code more suitable for unit testing</title><link href="https://samanthaneilen.github.io/2017/12/29/tips-for-making-your-code-more-suitable-for-unit-tests.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tips for making your code more suitable for unit testing" /><published>2017-12-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-12-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://samanthaneilen.github.io/2017/12/29/tips%20for%20making%20your%20code%20more%20suitable%20for%20unit%20tests</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://samanthaneilen.github.io/2017/12/29/tips-for-making-your-code-more-suitable-for-unit-tests.html">&lt;p&gt;
Unit tests are important to test your business logic. Unit tests should not call actual services or the database and they should be able to run within a few minutes.
In this blogpost I want to give a few tips on how to make your codebase more suitable for writing unit tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interfaces and dependency injection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When dealing with legacy code you will often find that different functional classes are called with the new keyword throughout other functional classes. This will often get in the way of writing a true unit test that only tests the method that you are working on.
Mitigate the problem by extracting an interface for the class whose functionality you want to access and instead pass the interface into the constructor of the class that will use the class. 
An example of code that instantiates a direct link to an Entity Framework database context is shown below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CustomerService&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetCustomerOverview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ECommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Deleted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MapToCustomerViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Compile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MapToCustomerViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The GetCustomerOverview method above cannot be unit tested because all calls to the method will actually instantiate the Entity Framework context with a actual calls to the underlying database.
A refactored CustomerService with interfaces passed through the constructor is shown below.

            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HouseNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HouseNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HouseNumberExtension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HouseNumberExtension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ZipCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ZipCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;City&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The interface for my DbContext is shown below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;IECommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IDbSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;SaveChanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now you can create a unit test to the GetCustomerOverview method. I will describe how to create a mock Entity Framework class in the next section of this post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you are not using Entity Framework Code First but using the database designer, you must create a separate partial class of your DbContext and set the interface inheritance in the new custom partial class. If you add an interface in the generated file, it will be lost at the next code generation from the model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Making sure that all dependencies are passed to a class via the constructor is called dependency injection. To ensure that you do not have to new up all the dependencies in the constructors in the UI or other top layer of your application you can leverage a framework like &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn178463(v=pandp.30).aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; to handle all the dependency injection for you. An example of this can be found in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SamanthaNeilen/ECommerceSampleApplication&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ECommerceSampleApplication repository&lt;/a&gt; in the ECommerceApp.NetFramework.Web project. The Unity NuGet packages combined with a unity configuration file section map all the interfaces with the concrete implementations. .Net Core has a built in dependency injection framework.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When writing tests you will want to call only specific calls of an interface during a test. You can use a mocking framework like Moq to create and verify fake behavior on interface calls. More information and examples of Moq can be found &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mocking Entity Framework&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When using Entity Framwork 6 and onward you can use the mock implementation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn314431(v=vs.113).aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this MSDN post&lt;/a&gt; to simulate an entity framework without having to use a mocking framework to mock out all the calls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An example of a testclass, using the mock framework and the refactored GetCustomerOverview method of the previous section, would look like the code snippet below (This test class uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/NUnit-Documentation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the NUnit framework&lt;/a&gt; for writing and running the tests):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CustomerServiceTests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IECommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_eCommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_customerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SetUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_eCommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MockECommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_customerService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CustomerService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_eCommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_eCommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Test customer 1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Deleted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_eCommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Test customer 2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Deleted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_eCommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Test customer 3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Deleted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My mock DbContext implementation is shown below:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;MockECommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IECommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MockECommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TestDbSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IDbSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SaveChangesCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;SaveChanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SaveChangesCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The implementation of the TestDbSet is found in the MSDN post referenced earlier in this section.
When using Entity Framework below version 6 look at the same MSDN post on how to write unit tests using interfaces and mock classes for the Entity Framework database context.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dealing with 3rd party classes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When writing .Net code you will probably use NuGet packages or other 3rd party references that do not always have interfaces available. 
The class below uses 2 external packages. FileHelpers to enable CSV exports and DotNetZip to create a ZipFile on the filesystem.

            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HouseNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HouseNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HouseNumberExtension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HouseNumberExtension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ZipCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ZipCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;City&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The FileHelperEngine class already has an interface and can be easily refactored but the ZipFile implementation does not. The ZipFile class also does not allow itself to be mocked properly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A solution to mitigate these issues is to create an Inherited object on which we can create an interface and thus create a mock object. The inherited object which I have called Adapter after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adapter Design principle&lt;/a&gt; is shown below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ZipFileAdapter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ZipFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IZipFile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ZipFileAdapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UseZip64WhenSaving&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Zip64Option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AsNecessary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CompressionLevel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CompressionLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BestCompression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;        

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IZipEntry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IZipFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ZipEntryAdapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;IZipFile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Zip64Option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UseZip64WhenSaving&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CompressionLevel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CompressionLevel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IZipEntry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Because I also wanted to use the created ZipEntry after calling AddFile I also had to create an Adapter for the ZipEntry class. The implementation of this class is shown below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ZipEntryAdapter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IZipEntry&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ZipEntry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_zipEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ZipEntryAdapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ZipEntry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;zipEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_zipEntry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;zipEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_zipEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_zipEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;IZipEntry&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Notice that in the adapters above that I only implemented and extracted the interfaces that I actually use. It is not necessary to extract all the functionality of the third party code if you never call it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that I have interfaces for all my ExportService dependencies I can refactor my ExportService class and write the appropriate unittest for the public CreateCustomerOverviewZipFile method.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ExportService&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_exportLocation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConfigurationManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AppSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ExportLocation&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_customerOverviewExportName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;CustomerOverview&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IFileHelperEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerExport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_fileExporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ExportService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IFileHelperEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerExport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fileExporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IECommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eCommerceDbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IZipFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateCustomerOverviewZipFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

Unit tests should not call actual services or the database and they should be able to run within a few minutes. In this blogpost I want to give a few tips on how to make your codebase more suitable for writing unit tests. Interfaces and dependency injection When dealing with legacy code you will often find that different functional classes are called with the new keyword throughout other functional classes. This will often get in the way of writing a true unit test that only tests the method that you are working on. Mitigate the problem by extracting an interface for the class whose functionality you want to access and instead pass the interface into the constructor of the class that will use the class. An example of code that instantiates a direct link to an Entity Framework database context is shown below. public class CustomerService { public IEnumerable&amp;lt;CustomerViewModel&amp;gt; GetCustomerOverview() { return (new ECommerceDbContext()).Customer .Where(customer =&amp;gt; !customer.Deleted) .Select(MapToCustomerViewModel().Compile()); } private Expression&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;Customer, CustomerViewModel&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MapToCustomerViewModel() { return customer =&amp;gt; new CustomerViewModel { Id = customer.Id, Name = customer.Name, EmailAdress = customer.EmailAdress, PhoneNumber = customer.PhoneNumber, Street = customer.Street, HouseNumber = customer.HouseNumber, HouseNumberExtension = customer.HouseNumberExtension, ZipCode = customer.ZipCode, City = customer.City, Country = customer.Country }; } } The GetCustomerOverview method above cannot be unit tested because all calls to the method will actually instantiate the Entity Framework context with a actual calls to the underlying database. A refactored CustomerService with interfaces passed through the constructor is shown below. public class CustomerService { private readonly IECommerceDbContext _eCommerceDbContext; public CustomerService(IECommerceDbContext eCommerceDbContext) { _eCommerceDbContext = eCommerceDbContext; } public IEnumerable&amp;lt;CustomerViewModel&amp;gt; GetCustomerOverview() { return _eCommerceDbContext.Customer .Where(customer =&amp;gt; !customer.Deleted) .Select(MapToCustomerViewModel().Compile()); } private Expression&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;Customer, CustomerViewModel&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MapToCustomerViewModel() { return customer =&amp;gt; new CustomerViewModel { Id = customer.Id, Name = customer.Name, EmailAdress = customer.EmailAdress, PhoneNumber = customer.PhoneNumber, Street = customer.Street, HouseNumber = customer.HouseNumber, HouseNumberExtension = customer.HouseNumberExtension, ZipCode = customer.ZipCode, City = customer.City, Country = customer.Country }; } } The interface for my DbContext is shown below. public interface IECommerceDbContext { IDbSet&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt; Customer { get; set; } int SaveChanges(); } Now you can create a unit test to the GetCustomerOverview method. I will describe how to create a mock Entity Framework class in the next section of this post. If you are not using Entity Framework Code First but using the database designer, you must create a separate partial class of your DbContext and set the interface inheritance in the new custom partial class. If you add an interface in the generated file, it will be lost at the next code generation from the model. Making sure that all dependencies are passed to a class via the constructor is called dependency injection. To ensure that you do not have to new up all the dependencies in the constructors in the UI or other top layer of your application you can leverage a framework like Unity to handle all the dependency injection for you. An example of this can be found in my ECommerceSampleApplication repository in the ECommerceApp.NetFramework.Web project. The Unity NuGet packages combined with a unity configuration file section map all the interfaces with the concrete implementations. .Net Core has a built in dependency injection framework. When writing tests you will want to call only specific calls of an interface during a test. You can use a mocking framework like Moq to create and verify fake behavior on interface calls. More information and examples of Moq can be found here. Mocking Entity Framework When using Entity Framwork 6 and onward you can use the mock implementation in this MSDN post to simulate an entity framework without having to use a mocking framework to mock out all the calls. An example of a testclass, using the mock framework and the refactored GetCustomerOverview method of the previous section, would look like the code snippet below (This test class uses the NUnit framework for writing and running the tests): public class CustomerServiceTests { private IECommerceDbContext _eCommerceDbContext; private CustomerService _customerService; [SetUp] public void Initialize() { _eCommerceDbContext = new MockECommerceDbContext(); _customerService = new CustomerService(_eCommerceDbContext); _eCommerceDbContext.Customer.Add(new Customer { Id = 1, Name = &quot;Test customer 1&quot;, Deleted = false }); _eCommerceDbContext.Customer.Add(new Customer { Id = 2, Name = &quot;Test customer 2&quot;, Deleted = true }); _eCommerceDbContext.Customer.Add(new Customer { Id = 3, Name = &quot;Test customer 3&quot;, Deleted = false }); } [Test] public void GetCustomerOverview_Should_Return_Non_Deleted_Customers() { // ACT var result = _customerService.GetCustomerOverview(); // ASSERT Assert.IsInstanceOf&amp;lt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;CustomerViewModel&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(result); Assert.IsTrue(result.Any(e =&amp;gt; e.Id == 1)); Assert.IsFalse(result.Any(e =&amp;gt; e.Id == 2)); Assert.IsTrue(result.Any(e =&amp;gt; e.Id == 3)); } } My mock DbContext implementation is shown below: public class MockECommerceDbContext : IECommerceDbContext { public MockECommerceDbContext() { this.Customer = new TestDbSet&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt;(); } public IDbSet&amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt; Customer { get; set; } public int SaveChangesCount { get; private set; } public int SaveChanges() { this.SaveChangesCount++; return 1; } } The implementation of the TestDbSet is found in the MSDN post referenced earlier in this section. When using Entity Framework below version 6 look at the same MSDN post on how to write unit tests using interfaces and mock classes for the Entity Framework database context. Dealing with 3rd party classes When writing .Net code you will probably use NuGet packages or other 3rd party references that do not always have interfaces available. The class below uses 2 external packages. FileHelpers to enable CSV exports and DotNetZip to create a ZipFile on the filesystem. public class ExportService: IExportService { private readonly string _exportLocation = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&quot;ExportLocation&quot;]; private const string _customerOverviewExportName = &quot;CustomerOverview&quot;; public IZipFile CreateCustomerOverviewZipFile() { if (!Directory.Exists(_exportLocation)) { Directory.CreateDirectory(_exportLocation); } var customerOverViewExportFileLocation = $&quot;{_exportLocation}{_customerOverviewExportName}.csv&quot;; CreateExportFile(customerOverViewExportFileLocation); return ZipExportFile(customerOverViewExportFileLocation); } private ZipFile ZipExportFile(string customerOverViewExportFileLocation) { var zipfile = new ZipFile(); zipfile.Name = $&quot;{_customerOverviewExportName}.zip&quot;; var zipentry = zipfile.AddFile(customerOverViewExportFileLocation); zipentry.FileName = $&quot;{_customerOverviewExportName}.csv&quot;; zipfile.Save($&quot;{_exportLocation}{zipfile.Name}&quot;); return zipfile; } private void CreateExportFile(string customerOverViewExportFileLocation) { var customerData = (new ECommerceDbContext()).Customer .Where(customer =&amp;gt; !customer.Deleted) .Select(MapToCustomerExportModel().Compile()); (new FileHelperEngine&amp;lt;CustomerExport&amp;gt;()).WriteFile(customerOverViewExportFileLocation, customerData); } private Expression&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;Customer, CustomerExport&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MapToCustomerExportModel() { return customer =&amp;gt; new CustomerExport { Name = customer.Name, EmailAdress = customer.EmailAdress, PhoneNumber = customer.PhoneNumber, Street = customer.Street, HouseNumber = customer.HouseNumber, HouseNumberExtension = customer.HouseNumberExtension, ZipCode = customer.ZipCode, City = customer.City, Country = customer.Country }; } } The FileHelperEngine class already has an interface and can be easily refactored but the ZipFile implementation does not. The ZipFile class also does not allow itself to be mocked properly. A solution to mitigate these issues is to create an Inherited object on which we can create an interface and thus create a mock object. The inherited object which I have called Adapter after the Adapter Design principle is shown below. public class ZipFileAdapter : ZipFile, IZipFile { public ZipFileAdapter() { UseZip64WhenSaving = Zip64Option.AsNecessary; CompressionLevel = CompressionLevel.BestCompression; } IZipEntry IZipFile.AddFile(string location) { return new ZipEntryAdapter(AddFile(location)); } } public interface IZipFile { Zip64Option UseZip64WhenSaving { get; set; } CompressionLevel CompressionLevel { get; set; } string Name { get; set; } IZipEntry AddFile(string location); void Save(string location); } Because I also wanted to use the created ZipEntry after calling AddFile I also had to create an Adapter for the ZipEntry class. The implementation of this class is shown below. public class ZipEntryAdapter : IZipEntry { private ZipEntry _zipEntry; public ZipEntryAdapter(ZipEntry zipEntry) { _zipEntry = zipEntry; } public string FileName { get { return _zipEntry.FileName; } set { _zipEntry.FileName = value; } } } public interface IZipEntry { string FileName { get; set; } } Notice that in the adapters above that I only implemented and extracted the interfaces that I actually use. It is not necessary to extract all the functionality of the third party code if you never call it. Now that I have interfaces for all my ExportService dependencies I can refactor my ExportService class and write the appropriate unittest for the public CreateCustomerOverviewZipFile method. public class ExportService { private readonly string _exportLocation = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&quot;ExportLocation&quot;]; private const string _customerOverviewExportName = &quot;CustomerOverview&quot;; private readonly IFileHelperEngine&amp;lt;CustomerExport&amp;gt; _fileExporter; private readonly IECommerceDbContext _eCommerceDbContext; public ExportService(IFileHelperEngine&amp;lt;CustomerExport&amp;gt; fileExporter, IECommerceDbContext eCommerceDbContext) { _fileExporter = fileExporter; _eCommerceDbContext = eCommerceDbContext; } public IZipFile CreateCustomerOverviewZipFile() { if (!Directory.Exists(_exportLocation)) { Directory.CreateDirectory(_exportLocation); } var customerOverViewExportFileLocation = $&quot;{_exportLocation}{_customerOverviewExportName}.csv&quot;; CreateExportFile(customerOverViewExportFileLocation); return ZipExportFile(customerOverViewExportFileLocation); } private IZipFile ZipExportFile(string customerOverViewExportFileLocation) { var container = new UnityContainer(); container.LoadConfiguration(); var zipfile = container.Resolve&amp;lt;IZipFile&amp;gt;(); zipfile.Name = $&quot;{_customerOverviewExportName}.zip&quot;; var zipentry = zipfile.AddFile(customerOverViewExportFileLocation); zipentry.FileName = $&quot;{_customerOverviewExportName}.csv&quot;; zipfile.Save($&quot;{_exportLocation}{zipfile.Name}&quot;); return zipfile; } private void CreateExportFile(string customerOverViewExportFileLocation) { var customerData = _eCommerceDbContext.Customer .Where(customer =&amp;gt; !customer.Deleted) .Select(MapToCustomerExportModel().Compile()); _fileExporter.WriteFile(customerOverViewExportFileLocation, customerData); } private Expression&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;Customer, CustomerExport&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MapToCustomerExportModel() { return customer =&amp;gt; new CustomerExport { Name = customer.Name, EmailAdress = customer.EmailAdress, PhoneNumber = customer.PhoneNumber, Street = customer.Street, HouseNumber = customer.HouseNumber, HouseNumberExtension = customer.HouseNumberExtension, ZipCode = customer.ZipCode, City = customer.City, Country = customer.Country }; } } public class ExportServiceTests { private readonly string _exportLocation = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&quot;ExportLocation&quot;]; private const string _customerOverviewExportName = &quot;CustomerOverview&quot;; private string _customerOverViewExportFileLocation; private Mock&amp;lt;IFileHelperEngine&amp;lt;CustomerExport&amp;gt;&amp;gt; _mockFileExporter; private IECommerceDbContext _eCommerceDbContext; private ExportService _exportService; [SetUp] public void Initialize() { _customerOverViewExportFileLocation = $&quot;{_exportLocation}{_customerOverviewExportName}.csv&quot;; _eCommerceDbContext = new MockECommerceDbContext(); _mockFileExporter = new Mock&amp;lt;IFileHelperEngine&amp;lt;CustomerExport&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(); _exportService = new ExportService(_mockFileExporter.Object, _eCommerceDbContext); _eCommerceDbContext.Customer.Add(new Customer { Id = 1, Name = &quot;Test customer 1&quot;, Deleted = false }); _eCommerceDbContext.Customer.Add(new Customer { Id = 2, Name = &quot;Test customer 2&quot;, Deleted = true }); _eCommerceDbContext.Customer.Add(new Customer { Id = 3, Name = &quot;Test customer 3&quot;, Deleted = false }); _mockFileExporter.Setup(exporter =&amp;gt; exporter.WriteFile(_customerOverViewExportFileLocation, NonDeletedCustomers())).Verifiable(); } [Test] public void CreateCustomerOverviewZipFile_Should_Export_Non_Deleted_Customers() { // ACT var result = _exportService.CreateCustomerOverviewZipFile(); // ASSERT Assert.IsInstanceOf&amp;lt;IZipFile&amp;gt;(result); _mockFileExporter.Verify(exporter =&amp;gt; exporter.WriteFile(_customerOverViewExportFileLocation, NonDeletedCustomers())); var mockZipfile = result as MockZipFile; Assert.AreEqual(1, mockZipfile.ZipEntries.Count); Assert.AreEqual($&quot;{_customerOverviewExportName}.csv&quot;, mockZipfile.ZipEntries[0].FileName); Assert.AreEqual(_customerOverViewExportFileLocation, mockZipfile.ZipEntries[0].Location); } private IEnumerable&amp;lt;CustomerExport&amp;gt;

	When building an application I also want to manage changes to the database from source control. One of the ways of doing this is with a Visual Studio SQL Server Database project. It integrates well with source control and can be integrated in automatic deployments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All screenshots and used techniques that are written in this post are available within Visual Studio 2017 community edition and SQL Server 2017 express edition that are both free downloads.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SQL Server Database project type can be found in the New Project window under de SQL Server templates as shown below:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/DatabaseProject.png&quot; alt=&quot;Database Project&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This project will just create an empty project without any objects.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/EmptyDatabaseProjectSolution.png&quot; alt=&quot;Empty Database Project Solution Explorer&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can now start to adding new items like tables, views, stored procedures and all kinds of other SQL Server database objects. A good practice is to put these objects into folders representing the different database objects for better maintainability.
	You can also import objects from an existing database by right clicking on the project and select Import from the available options ( the import database and dacpac options are only available when the database project is still empty).
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
	When creating an object like a table, Visual Studio will show an editor as shown in the image below. You can leverage the designer combined with the properties window to define fields and column settings or just type in the SQL statements in the T-SQL window on the lower left side.
	Below you can see an example of how I created a simple Customer table.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/DesignView.png&quot; alt=&quot;Designer View Visual Studio&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After creating or changing objects in your project you can publish these changes to a database with the Schema Compare option in the project context menu.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/SchemaCompareContextMenu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Schema Compare Context Option&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Use the select target drop down to go through the dialogs to select the database that you want to publish to.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/SchemaCompareSelectTarget.png&quot; alt=&quot;Schema Compare Select Target&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After selecting the database the Compare button on the upper left will become enabled and you can click it to kick off the compare between your database and the project. You can click on an object to see the changes between the specific objects.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/SchemaCompareTableChanges.png&quot; alt=&quot;Schema Compare Table changes&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you want to update the database to reflect the changes made, click the update button. You can deselect unwanted changes with the checkboxes in the Action column of the SchemaCompare tab. Visual Studio will show if the changes were successful and give you some options to view details.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/SchemaCompareUpdateSuccesful.png&quot; alt=&quot;Schema Compare Update Succesful&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the update fails, when you for example add a new non nullable column without a default value or deleting a column with data, the results will show like below:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/SchemaCompareUpdateFailed.png&quot; alt=&quot;Schema Compare Update Failed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By clicking View Results you see the script that was run but also a tab that shows the message of what went wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/SchemaCompareUpdateFailedMessage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Schema Compare Update Failed Message&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can either force the data loss by changing the schema compare options via the gear icon of the schema compare tab  as shown below or run an update script to mitigate the data loss.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/SchemaCompareOptions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Schema Compare Options&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In my case I had a faulty existing Countr column that did not match a newly created Country column. To get schema compare to update my database I had to created a data migration pre-upgrade script as shown below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Countr'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object_ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'dbo.Customer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Country'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object_ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'dbo.Customer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;BEGIN&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;ALTER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NVARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;
 
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sqlCommand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'UPDATE Customer SET Country = Countr'&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;EXEC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sqlCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;ALTER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;DROP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Countr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The update is a dynamic statement  because the script will not compile with a column name that does not exist before the upgrade script has been run. Notice that the IF statement is very specific to this change in the database. This is because we can add this script as a Pre-Deployment Script to the database project.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/ScriptFileOptions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Script File Options&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even if we have to run the script manually when using a schema compare, Pre- and Post-Deployment scripts will be run automatically when running the database project (F5) on a database, or when deploying the bacpac file that is the output of this project (found in the bin folder after building the project). The connection string that is used when running/debugging the project can be found and changed in the properties pages of the project in the Debug tab. There is also a SQL Script in the output folder that can be used to upgrade a database. The Pre- and Post-Deployment scripts are contained within the SQL script that is the output of the project.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/ProjectPropertyPages.png&quot; alt=&quot;Project Property Pages&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once all known instances of the database are updated with the specific Pre-Deployment script. It can be removed to avoid clutter of the project. 
	The specific IF statement will ensure that the statements are only run on a database that can do the specific data migration and skips it when creating a completely new instance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These projects are really only for managing schema information not data. If you want to secure your data, you need to create regular (scheduled) backups of your database. 
	We can use Post-Deployment scripts to add seed data to tables when they are empty. An example is show below:
&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;VALUES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'My test customer 3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'company3@test.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0997654432'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'StreetStuff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'8261SK'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'CityStuff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'TestCountry'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	So now we have project that can be plugged into source control. All the objects are stored as SQL files and work well in source control comparing and merging.
	If you have any manual scripts, that you might want to run periodicly, store them with the solution in a seperate solution items folder so they will not be compiled into the project output.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The dacpac files that are the output of the project can be used by an automated or manual deployment process to change the databases in your environments. Once you update the database, it will remember the version of the dacpac used to update the database. The project has a refactorlog file reflecting all changes made in a sequential form. Once  a dacpac version has been applied with the changes and you want to run the dacpac again after making manual modifications to the database, it will not be able to restore properly to the intended database state .This is why during development you will usually be using the Schema Compare functionality and running 
	Pre- and Post-Deployment scripts manually untill all changes are ready and the dacpac reflecting the next sequential update will be pushed out to your testing and eventualy production environments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have a dacpac file you can deploy it in manually in SQL Server Management Studio with the option below for a new database:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/ManagementStudioDeploy.png&quot; alt=&quot;SQL Management Studio Deploy&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Or use the option below on an existing database to upgrade it:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171124/ManagementStudioUpgrade.png&quot; alt=&quot;SQL Management Studio Upgrade&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are using VSTS for authomatic deployments, you can add a step to deploy dacpac files.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="VisualStudio" /><category term="SQLServer" /><summary type="html">When building an application I also want to manage changes to the database from source control. One of the ways of doing this is with a Visual Studio SQL Server Database project. It integrates well with source control and can be integrated in automatic deployments. All screenshots and used techniques that are written in this post are available within Visual Studio 2017 community edition and SQL Server 2017 express edition that are both free downloads. The SQL Server Database project type can be found in the New Project window under de SQL Server templates as shown below: This project will just create an empty project without any objects. You can now start to adding new items like tables, views, stored procedures and all kinds of other SQL Server database objects. A good practice is to put these objects into folders representing the different database objects for better maintainability. You can also import objects from an existing database by right clicking on the project and select Import from the available options ( the import database and dacpac options are only available when the database project is still empty). When creating an object like a table, Visual Studio will show an editor as shown in the image below. You can leverage the designer combined with the properties window to define fields and column settings or just type in the SQL statements in the T-SQL window on the lower left side. Below you can see an example of how I created a simple Customer table. After creating or changing objects in your project you can publish these changes to a database with the Schema Compare option in the project context menu. Use the select target drop down to go through the dialogs to select the database that you want to publish to. After selecting the database the Compare button on the upper left will become enabled and you can click it to kick off the compare between your database and the project. You can click on an object to see the changes between the specific objects. If you want to update the database to reflect the changes made, click the update button. You can deselect unwanted changes with the checkboxes in the Action column of the SchemaCompare tab. Visual Studio will show if the changes were successful and give you some options to view details. When the update fails, when you for example add a new non nullable column without a default value or deleting a column with data, the results will show like below: By clicking View Results you see the script that was run but also a tab that shows the message of what went wrong. You can either force the data loss by changing the schema compare options via the gear icon of the schema compare tab as shown below or run an update script to mitigate the data loss. In my case I had a faulty existing Countr column that did not match a newly created Country column. To get schema compare to update my database I had to created a data migration pre-upgrade script as shown below. IF EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM sys.columns WHERE Name = N'Countr' AND Object_ID = Object_ID(N'dbo.Customer')) AND NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM sys.columns WHERE Name = N'Country' AND Object_ID = Object_ID(N'dbo.Customer')) BEGIN ALTER TABLE Customer ADD Country NVARCHAR(100) NULL DECLARE @sqlCommand varchar(1000) = 'UPDATE Customer SET Country = Countr' EXEC(@sqlCommand) ALTER TABLE Customer DROP Countr END The update is a dynamic statement because the script will not compile with a column name that does not exist before the upgrade script has been run. Notice that the IF statement is very specific to this change in the database. This is because we can add this script as a Pre-Deployment Script to the database project. Even if we have to run the script manually when using a schema compare, Pre- and Post-Deployment scripts will be run automatically when running the database project (F5) on a database, or when deploying the bacpac file that is the output of this project (found in the bin folder after building the project). The connection string that is used when running/debugging the project can be found and changed in the properties pages of the project in the Debug tab. There is also a SQL Script in the output folder that can be used to upgrade a database. The Pre- and Post-Deployment scripts are contained within the SQL script that is the output of the project. Once all known instances of the database are updated with the specific Pre-Deployment script. It can be removed to avoid clutter of the project. The specific IF statement will ensure that the statements are only run on a database that can do the specific data migration and skips it when creating a completely new instance. These projects are really only for managing schema information not data. If you want to secure your data, you need to create regular (scheduled) backups of your database. We can use Post-Deployment scripts to add seed data to tables when they are empty. An example is show below: IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT TOP(1) [Name] FROM Customer) BEGIN INSERT INTO Customer ([Name],[Emailadress],[Phonenumber],[Street], [Housenumber], [HousenumberExtension], [Zipcode], [City], [Country]) VALUES ('My test customer 1', 'company@testcompany1.com', '0123456789', 'TestStreet', 4, NULL, '1111AA', 'TestCity', 'TestCountry'); INSERT INTO Customer ([Name],[Emailadress],[Phonenumber],[Street], [Housenumber], [HousenumberExtension], [Zipcode], [City], [Country]) VALUES ('My test customer 2', 'info@somecompany.com', '0112233445', 'SomeStreet', 2, 'a', '5555UD', 'SomeCity', 'TestCountry'); INSERT INTO Customer ([Name],[Emailadress],[Phonenumber],[Street], [Housenumber], [HousenumberExtension], [Zipcode], [City], [Country]) VALUES ('My test customer 3', 'company3@test.com', '0997654432', 'StreetStuff', 4, NULL, '8261SK', 'CityStuff', 'TestCountry'); END So now we have project that can be plugged into source control. All the objects are stored as SQL files and work well in source control comparing and merging. If you have any manual scripts, that you might want to run periodicly, store them with the solution in a seperate solution items folder so they will not be compiled into the project output.

	I would like to start my blog with a post of how I set up this blog. 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you start a Github account you can use a repository with the name username.github.io to host a website. That website will be hosted at the url &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;https://username.github.com&lt;/a&gt;. These websites on Github are called Github Pages. You can also create a website for a specific repository. Seeing as you can create a free Github account as long as you don't want or need private repositories, this is a great way to host a blog or website for free. For more information see &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Github pages promotes Jekyll as a tool to build static websites. It's not officially supported from windows but so for installing it and running it on my Windows 10 (2017 Fall Creators Update) has worked out fine so far.
	See &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Jekyll website&lt;/a&gt; for installation instructions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were a few points in the installation that I had to look up because of my unfamiliarity with Linux so I've included a description below of the steps taken after installing the Ubuntu store app from windows.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installing Jekyll on windows10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After I installed the Ubuntu app and started it as an Administrator I got an error. The link in the error shows you to the MSDN page explaining that you have to run a Powershell command to actually enable the Linux subsystem for Windows.
For more information see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The command that needs to be run (as administrator in Powershell) was:

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Online&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-FeatureName&lt;/span&gt; Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the reboot start the Ubuntu terminal app again as administrator. It will now show the screen below:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171118/UbuntuInstallingMessage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu Installing Message&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The terminal actually froze up for me the first time here, so if it's not continuing after a few minutes, just close and restart the app. (This may happen a few times when configuring the shell or downloading and updating the packages needed to install Jekyll. Also sometimes the editor seems to not take keyboard input when prompted to press enter or cntrl-c, when that happens click a few times within the editor to get the focus back correctly in the terminal and it will accept the command.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When it's done, you will see an active command line with root@computername:~#&lt;br /&gt;
Enter the command below to start bash (the Jekyll website just stated bash without the sudo keyword but the sudo keyword is needed).

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It may prompt you for a username and password. (Be aware you will need that password every time you start up bash. Also the text cursor will not show any signs off accepting input like stars or underscores but it will register your keystrokes). I have installed the terminal on 2 different computers. On one I did not get prompted for the separate login on the other I did need it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Run the commands as provided on the Jekyll site for &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the installation on windows&lt;/a&gt;. When it shows multiple commands in one code block run them per command and don't paste them in all at once). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also it may give the message below. You can continue by pressing enter and run the next command when it finishes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171118/BrightboxRubyMessage.png&quot; alt=&quot;BrightBox Ruby Message&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After all the commands have run and Jekyll is returning a version number you can navigate to a windows folder to create your first Jekyll website. The Ubuntu terminal is run from a separate sub filesystem so you need to enter the command below to navigate to your C:\ drive. 

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /mnt/c/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the C:\ directory you can just use the &quot;dir&quot; and &quot;cd&quot; commands to navigate to the appropriate folder the same way you would in a Windows command prompt. To create a new Jekyll website within your current folder use the command below. (note that you do not need to use the sudo keyword any more.)

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;jekyll new .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After it has finished you have a working default website that you van run with the command below.

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Customising your site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can now add pages like the one already generated in your _posts folder and alter the _config.yml file to populate the contents of your generated site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every time you make a change when Jekyll serve command is active or when you issue a Jekyll build command the contents of the _site folder get updated with the generated HTML site that you can access with your browser. This is also the content you can upload to your Git repository and thus will be hosted on your username.github.io website.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20171118/JekyllDefaultPage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jekkyl Default Page&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As you may notice the default site is quite barren but you do not see the files for the page layouts or the stylesheets. These files can be found in the folder that holds the default theme. It was installed with the other bundles in the Ubuntu terminal. As stated in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/&quot;&gt;Jekyll documentation&lt;/a&gt; ( you can find out where those files are located with the command below.

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;bundle show minima&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can copy the files from the theme folder and copy them into the folder of your Jekyll page to completely customize them. However the files installed by the Linux terminal are installed in a folder in your AppData folder. To access them from a windows explorer you need to enable hidden folders in your folder options and search for the &quot;gem&quot; in your %Users%\User\AppData folder to locate the installed ruby packages (including the minima package)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

After customizing your site template you can just worry about creating content pages. Any changes you make to your template at a later time will be reflected over all pages in the site. When uploading changes to your site repository, it may take a minute or so before changes are reflected in the browser.

When you start a Github account you can use a repository with the name username.github.io to host a website. That website will be hosted at the url https://username.github.com. These websites on Github are called Github Pages. You can also create a website for a specific repository. Seeing as you can create a free Github account as long as you don't want or need private repositories, this is a great way to host a blog or website for free. For more information see Github Pages. Github pages promotes Jekyll as a tool to build static websites. It's not officially supported from windows but so for installing it and running it on my Windows 10 (2017 Fall Creators Update) has worked out fine so far. See the Jekyll website for installation instructions. There were a few points in the installation that I had to look up because of my unfamiliarity with Linux so I've included a description below of the steps taken after installing the Ubuntu store app from windows. Installing Jekyll on windows10 After I installed the Ubuntu app and started it as an Administrator I got an error. The link in the error shows you to the MSDN page explaining that you have to run a Powershell command to actually enable the Linux subsystem for Windows. For more information see: Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux. The command that needs to be run (as administrator in Powershell) was: Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux After the reboot start the Ubuntu terminal app again as administrator. It will now show the screen below: The terminal actually froze up for me the first time here, so if it's not continuing after a few minutes, just close and restart the app. (This may happen a few times when configuring the shell or downloading and updating the packages needed to install Jekyll. Also sometimes the editor seems to not take keyboard input when prompted to press enter or cntrl-c, when that happens click a few times within the editor to get the focus back correctly in the terminal and it will accept the command.) When it's done, you will see an active command line with root@computername:~# Enter the command below to start bash (the Jekyll website just stated bash without the sudo keyword but the sudo keyword is needed). sudo bash It may prompt you for a username and password. (Be aware you will need that password every time you start up bash. Also the text cursor will not show any signs off accepting input like stars or underscores but it will register your keystrokes). I have installed the terminal on 2 different computers. On one I did not get prompted for the separate login on the other I did need it. Run the commands as provided on the Jekyll site for the installation on windows. When it shows multiple commands in one code block run them per command and don't paste them in all at once). Also it may give the message below. You can continue by pressing enter and run the next command when it finishes. After all the commands have run and Jekyll is returning a version number you can navigate to a windows folder to create your first Jekyll website. The Ubuntu terminal is run from a separate sub filesystem so you need to enter the command below to navigate to your C:\ drive. cd /mnt/c/ From the C:\ directory you can just use the &quot;dir&quot; and &quot;cd&quot; commands to navigate to the appropriate folder the same way you would in a Windows command prompt. To create a new Jekyll website within your current folder use the command below. (note that you do not need to use the sudo keyword any more.) jekyll new . After it has finished you have a working default website that you van run with the command below. jekyll serve Customising your site You can now add pages like the one already generated in your _posts folder and alter the _config.yml file to populate the contents of your generated site. Every time you make a change when Jekyll serve command is active or when you issue a Jekyll build command the contents of the _site folder get updated with the generated HTML site that you can access with your browser. This is also the content you can upload to your Git repository and thus will be hosted on your username.github.io website.
