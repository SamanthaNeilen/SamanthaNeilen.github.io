<h3 id="bootstrap"><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></h3>

<p>When creating a new website with .NET Core, the template will already contain the Bootstrap design framework. This framework uses a grid system for creating a layout, has some out-of-the-box styled controls like dropdowns and tabs and has an icon set to use. Next to the default color scheme, it has some guidance on how to create your own color schemes. Bootstrap also has an eco-system of templates based on Bootstrap to get inspiration for your own designs.</p>

<h3 id="office-fabric-core"><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/get-started">Office Fabric (Core)</a></h3>

<p>Another framework like Bootstrap is Office Fabric. This is a front-end design framework from Microsoft that can be used to design a website to look like an Office 365 application. This can be especially useful if you are creating a SharePoint hosted app or if you are creating  an app in an enterprise environment where users use a lot of the Office 365 websites. Users will get a certain feeling of consistency between all the applications and recognize iconography. The Core framework is a stylesheet that comes with a grid system, fonts, animation classes and an icon set that is used in Office 365 and contains icons for most Office applications. The website for Office Fabric also lists the colors for the Microsoft application. There are also out-of-the-box web controls, but these use the React framework. The controls that use just vanilla JavaScript have been marked deprecated.</p>

<h3 id="material-design"><a href="https://material.io/design/">Material Design</a></h3>

<p>Material Design is a set of design guidelines by Google. There are several Bootstrap implementations that use these guidelines. They give you easy access to an implementation of these guidelines for your application. <a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/components/demo/">Use this link for an overview of a few Bootstrap components with Material Design applied</a>. The provided link points to an implementation that has several implementations (free or paid) using JQuery, Angular, React and Vue.</p>

<h3 id="icon-sets">Icon sets</h3>

<p>When using one of the above design frameworks (or just using your own design), you may have need of some icons as a visual aid for a user. The links below point to some icon sets that you could use. When using icons from different frameworks or sources be aware that, just like fonts, icons from a different set may have a different line or edge shape. Mixing and matching icons from different sets may break the feeling of consistency for your user. If you really need or want to use an icon from a different set that you are already using, consider changing all or all related current icons to the new set. By related icons I mean the ones whose functionality or concept is similar and are usually near each other on the page.</p>

<p>The design frameworks in mentioned in this post adhere to a certain style and UX (user-experience) guidelines to help you create nicer looking sites. Using these frameworks is a good way of getting started but is not a sure way to create a good looking and usable site. Some links and resources to further content on what makes “good design” and “good user-experience” can be found listed below.</p>
